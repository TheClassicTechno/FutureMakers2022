# FutureMakers2022
##Day 1 (7/6/22) Reflection
I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing most questions (except the 2 hardest ones) without help. I knew python basics but needed a bit of refreshing on certain concepts. 

##Day 2 (7/7/22) Reflection
I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing most questions (except the 2 hardest ones) without help. I knew machine learning basics but needed a bit of refreshing on certain concepts. 

##Day 3 (7/11/22) Reflection
I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing all questions without help. I knew machine learning models and topics about them but needed a bit of refreshing on certain concepts. 

##Day 4 (7/12/22) Reflection 
I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing all questions without help. I'm familiar with tensorflow and deep neural networks and it was nice to get a refresher on these concepts.

##Day 5 (7/13/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing all questions without help. I would need some help with clarifying some of the concepts and questions about neural networks, but other than that I understand the gist of it.

##Day 6 (7/14/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing all questions without help. I would need some help with clarifying some of the concepts and questions about CNNs, but other than that I understand the gist of it.

##Day 7 (7/15/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing all questions without help. I have heard of bias from AI/ML before, but it was so amazing to learn more about how, why it happens, and how to fix it.

##Day 8 (7/18/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing most questions without help except 1. I am familiar with CNN concepts, feature maps, filters, etc., but it was very interesting to take a deep look into them technically by writing code to output them.

##Day 9 (7/19/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing almost all questions without help. I am familiar with basic concepts surrounding loss functions, but it was very interesting to take a deep look into them technically by writing code to compare and output different types of loss functions.

##Day 10 (7/20/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing most questions without help. I am familiar with basic concepts surrounding activation functions, but it was very complex and interesting to take a deep look into complex activation functions technically by writing code to define these functions.

##Day 11 (7/21/22) Reflection I finished all questions in the colab notebook assigned today, finishing all questions without help. I am familiar with basic concepts surrounding machine learning ethics and inclusion, but it was very interesting to take a deep look into intriguing questions and prompts surrounding how to make machine learning more ethical and inclusive for all.
